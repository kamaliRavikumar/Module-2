## ITERATIVE STATEMENTS â€“ PRINTING N NATURAL NUMBERS

###  Aim
To write a Python Program to print 1 to n Odd numbers in reverse order.
---

###  Algorithm

1. Start the program.
2. Read an integer input n.
3. Set up a loop to iterate i from n down to 1 (step -1).
4. For each i in the loop, check if i % 2 != 0 (i.e., i is odd).
5. If the condition is true, print i.
6. Continue the loop until all values from n to 1 are processed.
7. Terminate the program.

#Write your Code here

n=int(input())
for i in range(n,0,-1):
    if i%2!=0:
        print(i)
